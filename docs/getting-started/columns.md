# Column Specifications

The columns are specified for both source and destination, and determine how the data will be interpreted and transformed. A full example of all general options per column is shown below:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: id
    type: Uint8
    unique: True
  - name: name
    type: Utf8
    unique: False
  - name: another_unique_id
    type: Utf8
    unique: False
    skip_update: True
```

::: tip
There is work in progress on auto-discovery of source- and destination columns
:::

## Alternate column declaration
If you do not need to set any special settings for the columns, you can use the alternate syntax for column declaration to speed things up. This will cause the first field in the list to be set as unique:

```yaml
columns:
  uniqueField: Int32
  fieldA: Utf8
  fieldB: Int32
```

## Source Columns
The source columns are a representation of how the data should look when doing the comparison, meaning AFTER any source transformers have been applied.
You can retrieve any number of columns not listed in the columns-section, but they will neither be used for comparison or insertion if they are not specified. You can use them for transformations, though.

## Destination Columns
The destination columns are a representation of how the data looks when stored in the destination, without any applied transformations.

## Field types
There are a number of field types that can be used for the columns:

- Integer types: pl.Int8, pl.Int16, pl.Int32, pl.Int64
- Unsigned Integer types: pl.UInt8, pl.UInt16, pl.UInt32, pl.UInt64
- Float types: pl.Float32, pl.Float64
- Boolean: pl.Boolean
- Utf8: pl.Utf8
- Object: pl.Object

There are a number of more field types in the PolaRS library, but not all of them have been validated to work with Beetl yet. In particular, the Binary column is not going to work.

## Unique Fields
The unique fields determine how the comparison is made between source and destination, and don't have to correspond exactly with all unique columns in both datasets.

In the above ID column, the unique field is set to `True`. This will mean that the comparison is done like this:

1. Match all Source IDs to Destination IDs to find those that are missing (Create)
2. Match all Destination IDs to Source IDs to find those that are to be deleted (Delete)
3. Match all rows that exist in both datasets and compare the data to find those that are different (Update)

You can add multiple ID columns for a dataset, but there should never be no unique columns.

::: tip
If you transfer to/from SQL Server, make sure to transform the UUID (uniqueidentifier)s on the other end to uppercase since this is done by default in SQL Server.
If you don't do this, you will likely have all records updated every time.

## Skip Update
This means the field will be ignored during insertion, but can still be used for comparison.

## Multi-dimensional Data
If you use sources with multi-dimensional data (e.g. json, MongoDB, etc.), you can use the `pl.Object` type to store the entire data structure in a single column.
With many of the sources, you also have the option to flatten the data structure into multiple columns

### Objects
```yaml
allRows:
  - name: hello
    attrs:
      height: 100
      length: 200
      width: 300
  - name: world
    attrs:
      height: 240
      length: 120
      width: 360
```

This data structure will be flattened into the following columns:

| name | attrs.height | attrs.length | attrs.width |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| hello | 100 | 200 | 300 |
| world | 240 | 120 | 360 |

### Arrays
Arrays will generally be flattened to a pl.List type, and can then be modified and/or extracted with for example the strings.join or structs.jsonpath transformers

```yaml
- name: hello
  attrs:
    - 100
    - 200
    - 300
  deep:
    - nested: list
      deep_attr:
        - 1
      
...

# This will turn the above field into a comma-separated string
- transformer: strings.join
  config:
    inField: attrs
    separator: ", "

# This will extract the first element of the array under attrs
- transformer: structs.jsonpath
  config:
    inField: attrs
    path: "0"

# Jsonpath can also be used for deeper data structures
- transformer: structs.jsonpath
  config:
    inField: deep
    path: "0.deep_attr.0"
```
